CODATA school is 2 weeks training aimed to Low med income countries LMICs

Data skills for early career researchers
People who work with data - generic
Not just for bioinformatics

Variety of backgrounds
Tag line "simple things explained well"
aiming to provide a foundation

show the possibilities not deep dive
show communities - and don't feel isolated

Stop and think why they are involved in Open science
Discuss and let them realise from themselves if it is worth it
