## BD2KTCC
Jack from South California Training Coordinating Centre
Big Data to knowledge Program BD2K
Components of training for data science related to biomedical research
[bigdatau.org] = [https://bigdatau.ini.usc.edu/]

User statistics

ERuDIte - for training related resources

Educational Resource Discovery Index
Has metadata to search training
Automated scraped system - python
modules for each website

### Indexing data science resources
Youtube search for Data Science Education Ontology
Resulted in
- Automating tagging _ Stream to text
- Classification of the metadata
- Assaining ontologies
- Resources by topic in a knowledge map
- Bioschemas
- Clusters

### Learning Paths
How can people create learning paths (the users can decide what path they want
to follow) with this knowledge map
Cross Entropy to create the indexed courses/workshops and also linked it to
 google books. Starting project
[Clustering framework](bigdatau.org/erudite_cluster)
This is to inform a curriculum view, have an order

Cleaned links - about 10000 resources

## TeSS is a training portal
Several different institutions (third parties) provide learning and these are
collected in [TeSS](https://tess.elixir-europe.org)

Stores
- Events - Start and End date
- Materials - accessible at any point online

EDAM ontology for bioinformatics
AIII login

### Training workflows
- Concept maps
- Educational resources
- Learning paths
