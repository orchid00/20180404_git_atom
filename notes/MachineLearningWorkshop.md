# Machine Learning applied to bioinformatics

A week long workshop aimed at bioinformatics PhD students in their last year who want to learn more about machine learning (ML).

##Aim
Critical assessment of ML algorithms
With examples

## Prior knowledge
- Basic statistics
- Programming
- visualisation

## Learning outcomes
### Machine learning
1. Describe taxonomy of ML algorithms
2. Compare performance of ML algorithms
3. Choose appropriate ML algorithms for their data
4. Apply ML algorithms their own dataset

(KSAs)
### Statistics
1. Describe the type of data distribution of their dataset
2. Describe multiple hypotheses adjustment methods
3. Describe how confounding factors can affect inferences
4. Distinguish between significance and effect size
5. Defend choice of experimental design
(KSAs 5, 6, 7, 8, 11)
