# How to design instruction based on learning goals.

## Exercise 1 definition
Iterative programming in R using `purrr`

### Target Audience
- We welcome life scientists at different career levels to stimulate the conversation
- Entry level: attendees already program in R for data analysis
- Attendees have a positive attitude towards learning new concepts of iteration
- Attendees are ready to solve an iterative problem using new functions

### Required prior knowledge
- Familiarity using R and its data types
- In need of writing efficient iterations in their code
- Recommended to be exposed to the `tidyverse`
- Be familiar with writing simple functions
- Know the concept and use of a loop in programming

### Teaching goals (learning objectives)
Topics covered in the teaching/training (what the trainers wants to focus on)
- Strength and emphasis in R as a functional language
- Show enough examples to evidence efficient use of functions

### Learning Outcomes (KSA what the learner can demonstrate)
Focused on the learner
- Describe the power of a function
- Be able to explain why loops in R have been replaced with functions
- Practice with a small reproducible example
- Use different functions of the package `purrr` and explain the differences between them
- Differentiate functionality of `map` vs `walk`

### Preparation
- Do lots of exercises
- Find a dataset for the Audience
- Prepare notes

### Practice
- Check potential activities (from the slides 35-41)

### Feedback
- How was the exercise?
- Was there enough time to think about how to solve the exercises?
- Where there enough examples?

### Assessment
(slide 42) Questions for remembering
- Evaluate what kind of questions come out from the training
- Ask them how would they use the new learning
- What happened after loops? - apply family, and then map_ functions
- Which map function is good for numbers
- What is the major benefit of using a `purrr` function
- FALSE - If you wanted to save plots would you use map_ ?
- FALSE - If you wanted to return a new character column would you use map_dbl?




## Vocabulary

### Training
Training is defined as a function of skills or behaviours to be
learned («acquired») by practice in situ (Tractenberg, 2017)
The user's plans for using the skills is important in training

### Find opportunities to assess KSA's
knowledge - of the `purrr` main functions
Skills - identify which type of function to use
Ability - Apply map_ function for iterative problems
Ability - Extra: differentiate a loop or apply from a map function

### Long Term memory
- Encode information - see, hear, experience
- Process with **practice** leads to associations with our long term memory
- Store - After sufficient processing

### Bloom's Taxonomy applied to learning
Six hierarchical levels (from the base to top) 1956
From less complex to complex
1. Knowledge - Remembering by Reiterating
2. Comprehension - Understand by Summarising
3. Application - Illustrate by extrapolation
4. Analysis - Predict - connect parts of a concept
5. Synthesis - Create do something new (2001 - Evaluating)
6. Evaluation - Assessment (2001 - Creating)

## Framework

- KSAs
- Assessment
- Learning outcomes
